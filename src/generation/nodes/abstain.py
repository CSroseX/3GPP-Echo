"""abstain_node: the terminal node for every non-verified exit from the
generate/verify graph, replacing flag_unverified_node.

flag_unverified_node used to pass the last-generated answer through
unchanged and unbadged — the fact that verification never passed was
visible only in state fields (verification_passed / termination_reason),
never in the answer text itself. A caller inspecting only the answer
string had no way to tell a fully-grounded response from one that
failed verification three times.

abstain_node instead returns a structured abstention: which source
clauses were actually retrieved, which specific claims (if any) failed
entailment, and why the graph is ending here (termination_reason). It
does not fabricate a "the system doesn't know this" message when the
answer was in fact fine except for an operational hiccup (an
unavailable verifier) — that distinction is exactly what Phase 2's
typed exception boundary (see verify_claims_node) made possible to draw.
